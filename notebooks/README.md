# Notes on Jupyter notebooks

Keep notebooks here only! 

Note that notebooks are bad at being versioned. 
Use them for "experiments", but don't use as "production" code. If you have a feature you want to add, you should test it in a notebook and *then* add it to the module.

Generally, commit notebooks when you want to checkpoint progress, and when you're finished. Instead of changing an existing stable notebook, consider making a new one (as a separate "experiment").
